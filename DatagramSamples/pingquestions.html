		QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Why did more client output result when you added the loop
to read extra messages after each successful message receipt? Why
were some messages never printed? Why were some printed late and out
of order?</li>
<li class="a">
Looking at the server log and the client log , the server is configured to delay respones and drop packets randomly,
leading to packets arriving out of order , timeouts occuring on client side leading to retries and also receiving duplicate respones from the server for older messages.
</li>

<li class="q">What was confusing about this assignment or 
programming framework that we should
explain in more detail before proceeding to the next assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
 The instructions were detailed and clear enough and not confusing .
</li>


<li class="q">How much UDP (datagram) style programming did you already know before doing this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
I had some experience building a UDP file transfer reliability protocol through an assignment in CS112.
