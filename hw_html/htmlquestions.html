<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">What are the URI's for the files you have published? (Please make sure this is a publicly accessible absolute URI. If it's not, you will lose credit) Hint: this should <em>not</em> be a <code>file:</code> scheme URI!</li>
<li class="a">
<!-- Update the following by inluding the absolute URI in both the href and text -->
<!-- Remember: your absolute URI must begin with 
     https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~<yourloginname> -->
     
Web page is at: <a href=https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jchoud02/index.html>YourWebPageURI</a>
<br>
Stylesheet is at: <a href=https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~jchoud02/styles.css>YourStyleSheetURI</a>

</li>

<li class="q">How much HTML and CSS did you already know before starting this assignment?</li>
<li class="a">
  Basics - DOM ,general layout of a page and ways to style using CSS.
</li>

<li class="q">This assignment requires that you demonstrate at least three HTML features and at least three CSS features that you had not used before. Please list them (more than three is fine):</li>
<li class="a">
HTML Features:
<ul>
<li> This would be the use of span . </li>

<li>Setting up a table.  </li>
 
<li> Was not aware that h1 > h2 > h3 in text size , so it was possible to use h2 repeatedly to have same sized heading.</li>
</ul>
CSS Features:
<ul>
<li>Referencing elements by id or class .</li>
<li> Using multiple stylesheets for the same page.</li>
<li> Changing the 'a' element text color when it is hovered on . </li>
</ul>



<li class="q">Explain briefly the difference between a &lt;div> and a &lt;span></li>
<li class="a">
A div is a block while a span is inline - used to apply styling to a small chunk of text. 
</li>

<li class="q">What help did you receive from others? (You don't have to
indicate if someone just told you in general about an interesting HTML or CSS feature, or if they gave general
ideas for making your Web page(s) more interesting, but
you must identify any help you received with learning how to write or debug your code.)</li>
<li class="a">
 Did not discuss this assignment with anyone . 
</li>

<li class="q">Is there anything else we should know about grading your work (e.g. links we need to follow to see more)?</li>
<li class="a">
No 
</li>


<li class="q">Did you do any work for <a href="htmlassignment#extracredit">extra credit</a>?</li>
<li class="a">
 Although not significantly different , Have 2 stylesheets for the same html content. 
</li>


<li class="q">(will not be graded) Do you have any questions about learning HTML? Anything you'd like to see covered more carefully in class?:</li>
<li class="a">
Maybe some more about SVG , which I found hard to grasp from online resources in a short time.  
</li>
