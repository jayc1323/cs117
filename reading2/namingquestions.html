 <div class="qa">
<p>Please answer each of the following questions.</p>


<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">
Please make a list of issues or design characteristics that one
should consider in designing a naming system.
List as many as you can (within reason). You should use this as an opportunity to 
show your mastery of the naming concepts we have been discussing in the class.
I'll start you with a couple:
</li>
<li class="a">
Issues and design characteristics that should be considered when
designing a new naming system include:
<ul>
<li>What should be nameable using this naming system?</li>
<li>Where will the names be used, and by whom?</li>
<li>Can resources have multiple names or aliases ?</li>
<li>What does having different names imply about the resources referred to ? Could they have the same representation?</li>
<li> Can a set of names be owned by an entity? If there is a central authority that manages the naming system?</li>
<li> If there is a specific format a valid name should abide to?</li>
<li> To whom the names in a system would be accessible to ? And what operations are permitted on the resources these names refer to?</li>
</ul>
				      
</li>

<li class="q">Choose an existing naming system that interests you.
Examples include file naming in Unix/Linux systems, the phone
numbers discussed in your reading, etc. Many good examples
are related to computer systems, but if you prefer 
you can choose something else. 
<br>
<br>
For the system you choose, <em>explain the system you choose in sufficient detail so that someone who had never seen it before would understand the rest of your analysis</em>.
Explain where the system is used, and what can be named, what names look like and what the rules for assigning them are, etc. Then briefly explain 
how the system you choose does or does not deal with the issues you list above. 
Again, <em>the goal is to show your ability to apply the principles and insights we discussed in class</em>.
If your list above is very long, then just choose up to 8 important ones to deal with here.
WARNING: Don't assume that <em>you</em> know how a system works. In past years we've had many students give incorrect descriptions of, e.g. what the limitations are on Linux filenames, or what can be named with such names, because students based their answers on personal experience or assumptions rather than on how Linux really works. As in all technical writing, make sure that your explanations are correct! Even for systems you use a lot, you might want to find the specifications.
</li>
<li class="a">
An interesting naming system is the <em>IUPAC naming system</em>  used in organic chemistry and is specifically used for naming
naming organic compounds , compounds formed by covalent bonds between carbon atoms and other elements ,primarily hydrogen,oxygen,nitrogen.
This naming system is pretty comprehensive and covers much of the design principles and addresses many issues that come up when designing a naming system.

<br>
Every unique resource (in this case an organic compound) is addressed by a unique IUPAC name , forming a one to one mapping from names to compounds.
Every unique name refers to a unique compound , with the uniqueness depending on a variety of factors like the longest carbon chain,
functional groups attached to the parent chain, structure of the chain(if there is a cycle present or not) etc.
<br>
The specification states the following general rules for naming a compound:
The formation of a systematic name requires several steps, to be
taken (when they are applicable) in the following order: <br>
a. Determine the principal characteristic group to be cited as the
suffix.<br>
b. Determine the senior parent amongst those structural components
attached to a principal characteristic group.<br>
c. Name the parent hydride and specify any unsaturation .<br>
d. Combine the name of the parent hydride with the suffix for the
principal characteristic group .<br>
e. Identify the substituents and arrange the corresponding prefixes in
alphabetical order.<br>
f. Insert multiplicative prefixes, without changing the already
established order, and insert locants.<br>
g. Determine chirality centres and other stereogenic units, such as
double bonds, and add stereodescriptors.<br>

The above rules are compresehensive and resolve any ambiguities that arise when naming a compound.
An ambiguity with the naming system of the web is that two resources having the same data can have different names.
But that is not the case with the IUPAC naming system. The meaning of what a resource is can be abstract in web terminology and dependent on people managing that resource , but in 
the IUPAC system, the resource is always a chemical compound which makes it easier to have unique names for resources differing in some of the many characteristics of an organic compound.
<br>
But naming a resource on the web by its content is not a good idea as it would be hard to address a resource by the number of bytes it has or some other low level detail.
Instead resources are usually meant to be have a name that conveys some meaning about the resource ,making it easier to find or get it while the people using organic compound names would be people working in specialized jobs and hence it makes sense for a small number of people to follow a rigid set of naming guidelines.
But there are some tradeoffs to the flexibility in naming allowed by the web as we don't end up with a one to one mapping for the web naming system.
<br>
The IUPAC also retains some names for common compounds , making it easier to address these compounds , like 
Acids: <br>
Formic acid → methanoic acid,
Acetic acid → ethanoic acid,
Propionic acid → propanoic acid,
<br>
Other common ones: <br>
Acetone → propan-2-one
Formaldehyde → methanal

<br>
Hence , IUPAC naming system does address many issues that arise when building a naming system but their job is partly simplified
since the resources being named are organic compounds only ,making it easier to come up with a scheme based on defining characteristics 
of the compounds , which is not the case with web resources.
Hence , the design of a naming system is dependent on the resources/entities being named and what the features are to distinguish them , the kind of people using these names among other factors.
