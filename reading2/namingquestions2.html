		QUESTION

 <div class="qa">
<p>Please answer each of the following questions.</p>

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Consider this example URI: <code>http://example.com/homepage.html</code>.
According to TAG Finding <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31">The use of Metadata in URIs</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a> and other applicable 
specifications, which of the following statements is/are <em>definitely true</em>?</li>
<li class="nest">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">The example URI above is a reference to an HTML document? Briefly explain.</li>
<li class="a">Maybe a reference to an HTML document . The metadata of a url <em>does not guarantee</em> that the resource obtained will indeed have the expected MIME type as indicated by the URL.</li>
<li class="q">The example URI is absolute? Briefly explain.</li>
<li class="a">Yes , the example URI is absolute as it matches the absolute URI rule since it does not have a fragment identifier component.
     4.3 Absolute URI :  absolute-URI  = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ]
</li>
<li class="q">If you do an HTTP GET on the example URI from anywhere in the world, you will get the same thing? Which principle that we studied does this illustrate? Briefly explain.</li>
<li class="a">Yes , you will get the same thing if we do an HTTP GET on the example URI from anywhere in the world. 
     The principle that illustrates this is the principle that global naming leads to global network effects. <br>
     <code>http://example.com/homepage.html</code> is a global URI and global URIs resolve the same way everywhere in the world.
</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li class="q">While browsing the Web you visit a page from <code>greatdeals.com</code>, and from that page you follow a link by clicking on text that says: "Great Prices on Shoes".
You do indeed get another Web page, and you notice that the URI
in your address bar reads: <code>http://greatdeals.com/discounts?item=shoes</code>
According to TAG Finding <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31">The use of Metadata in URIs</a>:</li>
<li class="nest">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">The Web page you get should
be about discounts on shoes? (Yes or no? Briefly explain.)</li>
<li class="a">
     No , it shouldn't necessarily be about discounts on shoes. There is no constraint made by w3 that constrains the resource 
     a URI references to necessarily align with the metadata , but is generally good practise to have some meaning about the resource be inferred from the URI.

</li>
<li class="q">Again according to the finding, if you change the URI to read <code>http://greatdeals.com/discounts?item=gloves</code>, any Web page you get should be about discounts on gloves? (Yes or no? Briefly explain.)</li>
<li class="a">No ,this is an inference made by users that altering the parameters of the metadata should result in a similar page with discount for a different item.
     The resource the user expects to find is not even guaranteed to exist , and even if it does , the URI for it is not guarranteed to follow the same pattern unless explicitly stated by the host/authority of the URI.

</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li class="q">Consider the URI <code>http://example.com/maps?lat=42.408724&amp;long=-71.116179</code>.
According to the ABNF in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>?</li>
<li class="nest">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">The nonterminal (rule) that matches <code>http</code> is?</li>
<li class="a"> scheme= ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "-" / "." )</li>
<li class="q">The nonterminal that matches <code>lat=42.408724&amp;long=-71.116179</code> is?</li>
<li class="a"> query = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )</li>
<li class="q">True or false, the URI has a <code>hier-part</code>? If so, what is it? If not why not.</li>
<li class="a">If true, then which part of the URI is the <code>hier-part</code>?
  True , the hier-part is "example.com"</li>
<li class="q">True or false, the URI has a <code>path</code>?  If so, what is it? If not why not.</li>
<li class="a">If true, then which part of the URI is the <code>path</code>?
  Yes , the URI does have a path . The path is /maps?lat=42.408724&long=-71.116179</li>
</ol>
